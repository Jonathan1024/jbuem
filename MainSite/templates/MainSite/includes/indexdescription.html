                    John Brown University (JBU) campus currently has two photovoltaic (PV) arrays and a wind turbine
                    installed on campus. The wind turbine (3.5 kW) currently is only used for research/educational
                    purposes and does not contribute any power to the Balzer Technology Center (BTC), but the PV arrays
                    (i.e. Fronius (5 kW) and Enphase (5 kW) make contributions to the building by reducing the amount of
                    power BTC draws form the grid. This power monitoring project was started by Dr. Ted Song in the fall
                    of 2015 to measure and display the contributions of each of the renewable energy resources in real
                    time. The graph shown (not available on mobile devices) displays the last 24 hours of power
                    generation and consumption.
