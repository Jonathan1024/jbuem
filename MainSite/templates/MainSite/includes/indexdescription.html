            <h3>JBU: Energy Monitoring Project</h3>
            <p>
                The Balzer Technology Center contains several renewable energy resources - two solar arrays and a wind
                turbine. The wind turbine is only used for research purposes and does not contribute any power to the
                system, but the solar arrays (called fronius and enphase) do contribute to the power used by the
                building. The Energy Monitoring Project was started by Dr. Ted Song to measure and display the
                contributions of each of the sources. The graph to the left displays the last 24 hours of energy usage
                and consumption measured from the building and the solar arrays.
