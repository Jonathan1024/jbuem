<h1>Solar Energy Production</h1>
<p>
    The Balzer Technology Center has two 5500 watt solar arrays. One is an Enphase Solar Array and the other is a
    Fronius Solar Array. Hence the affectionate names Enphase and Fronius. Due to their positioning, the Fronius array
    produces more then the Enphase in the morning, and vise versa in the evenings.
