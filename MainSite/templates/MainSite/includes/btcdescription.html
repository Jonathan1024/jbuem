<h3>Balzer Technology Center: Smart Meter</h3>
<p>
    The energy usage of the Balzer Technology Center (BTC) is measured using an SEL smart meter. The smart meter monitors
    several aspects of the buildings power usage (include actual usage, imaginary power, power factor, etc). The power
    from the meter is measured after the input of the other resources (such as the solar arrays).
